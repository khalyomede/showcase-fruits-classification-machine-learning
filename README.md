# showcase-fruits-classification-machine-learning
An example to show my try on machine learning (bear with me it is my first ML program !)

# How to use
Here are the steps to quickly get started and try my project

## 1. Install Composer
If not already done, shame on you ! Just kidding, it is a great opportunity for you to get started with this awesome dependencies manager. Check it out [here](https://getcomposer.org/).

## 2. Download the project
You can manually download the project, or clone it using :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/khalyomede/showcase-fruits-classification-machine-learning
```

## 3. Update the dependencies
To be able to use my image helper, `Khalyomede\Image`, you will need to run this command in the directory of this project :
```bash
composer update
```

### 4. Run the project
#### 4.1 In a prompt command
Go to the directory `public`, then hit :
```bash
php index.php
```

#### 4.2. In a web server
If you have already your own server, just run the project and go to the public folder. If you prefer using built-in PHP web server, just run in the directory of the project (come back to the root of the directory) :
```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```
Then go check it out on your prefered web browser :
```bash
http://localhost:8000
```

Hope you enjoy !
